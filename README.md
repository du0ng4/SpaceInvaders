Project 1: SpaceInvaders

This program is the Space Invaders game, based on Alien Invasions.

Important Notes:
  The file 'scores.txt' which stores the high scores on disk, initially contains 0.  There must be an empty line at the end or else program will crash.  It is recommended to leave it alone to be safe.
